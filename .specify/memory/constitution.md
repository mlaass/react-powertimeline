# PowerTimeline Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Component-First Architecture (Radix UI Philosophy)
Every feature MUST be implemented as a reusable React 18 + TypeScript component following Radix UI design principles: unstyled, accessible, and composable. Components MUST be self-contained, independently testable, and leverage React 18 features (concurrent rendering, automatic batching). Each component MUST have a single, well-defined responsibility and expose a clean, strictly-typed TypeScript API with comprehensive type definitions. Components MUST be unstyled primitives that accept styling through props or CSS-in-JS. No business logic should leak into presentation components. All code MUST be written in TypeScript with strict mode enabled.

**Rationale**: Radix UI's philosophy ensures maximum flexibility, accessibility, and composability while React 18's concurrent features and TypeScript's type safety enable better performance and developer experience for complex timeline interactions.

### II. Performance-First with React 18 (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All implementations MUST prioritize performance for large datasets using React 18's concurrent features. Virtualization MUST be implemented for rendering optimization. SVG rendering MUST be optimized to handle thousands of data points without performance degradation. MUST leverage React 18's automatic batching, startTransition for non-urgent updates, and useDeferredValue for expensive computations. Memory usage MUST be monitored and optimized. Performance benchmarks MUST be established and maintained for all major features.

**Rationale**: Timeline components often handle large datasets; React 18's concurrent features enable better user experience during heavy rendering operations.

### III. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TDD is mandatory: Tests MUST be written first, approved by stakeholders, MUST fail initially, then implementation follows. Red-Green-Refactor cycle MUST be strictly enforced. All components MUST have unit tests, integration tests, and visual regression tests. Performance tests MUST verify rendering benchmarks.

**Rationale**: Complex visualization components require rigorous testing to ensure correctness and prevent regressions.

### IV. API Stability & TypeScript-First
All public APIs MUST be TypeScript-first with comprehensive type definitions. Breaking changes MUST follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). Props interfaces MUST be backward compatible within major versions. All public methods MUST be documented with JSDoc. Generic interfaces MUST support extensibility without breaking existing implementations.

**Rationale**: Component libraries require stable APIs for adoption; TypeScript ensures type safety and better developer experience.

### V. Accessibility-First (Radix UI Standard)
All components MUST be accessible by default following WCAG 2.1 AA standards and Radix UI accessibility patterns. MUST support keyboard navigation, screen readers, and focus management. Interactive elements MUST have proper ARIA attributes, roles, and states. Color and visual indicators MUST not be the sole means of conveying information. Components MUST be testable with accessibility testing tools.

**Rationale**: Timeline visualizations must be accessible to all users; following Radix UI's accessibility standards ensures inclusive design.

### VI. Documentation-First with Practical Examples
Every component MUST have comprehensive documentation including: Storybook stories, API documentation, accessibility features, and performance characteristics. Each feature MUST have practical, runnable examples in the `/examples` folder demonstrating real-world usage scenarios. Examples MUST be fully TypeScript-typed, self-contained, and cover common use cases, edge cases, and accessibility patterns. Documentation MUST be updated before code changes are merged.

**Rationale**: Complex visualization components require excellent documentation and practical examples for successful adoption and maintenance. Real-world examples accelerate developer onboarding and reduce support burden.

## Performance Standards

All implementations MUST meet these performance requirements using React 18 features:

- **Rendering**: Handle 10,000+ data points with <100ms initial render time using concurrent rendering
- **Interactions**: Pan/zoom operations MUST maintain 60fps on desktop, 30fps on mobile using startTransition for non-urgent updates
- **Memory**: Memory usage MUST not exceed 50MB for typical datasets (1,000-10,000 points)
- **Bundle Size**: Component bundle MUST not exceed 200KB gzipped
- **Virtualization**: MUST implement viewport-based rendering for datasets >1,000 items
- **Concurrent Features**: MUST use useDeferredValue for expensive calculations, automatic batching for state updates
- **Accessibility Performance**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader interactions MUST not degrade performance

Performance regressions are considered breaking changes and MUST be addressed before release.

## Examples & Documentation Structure

### Examples Folder Requirements
Every feature MUST have corresponding examples in the `/examples` folder with the following structure:
```
examples/
├── basic-timeline/           # Basic usage example
├── large-dataset/           # Performance demonstration
├── accessibility-demo/      # Accessibility features showcase
├── custom-styling/          # Styling and theming examples
├── interactive-features/    # Pan, zoom, selection examples
└── [feature-name]/         # Feature-specific examples
```

Each example MUST include:
- **README.md**: Clear setup instructions and feature explanation
- **TypeScript implementation**: Fully typed, runnable code
- **Package.json**: Dependencies and scripts for standalone execution
- **Live demo**: Deployable example that can be hosted
- **Accessibility notes**: How accessibility features work in the example

Examples MUST be maintained and updated with every feature change. Broken examples are considered critical bugs.

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Gates
- All code MUST pass TypeScript compilation with strict mode enabled
- All code MUST pass ESLint and Prettier formatting checks
- All tests MUST pass including unit, integration, visual regression, and accessibility tests
- All components MUST have Storybook stories demonstrating usage and accessibility features
- All examples MUST be runnable and up-to-date with current API
- Performance benchmarks MUST pass established thresholds
- Accessibility audits MUST pass WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- React 18 concurrent features MUST be properly implemented where applicable

### Review Process
- All PRs MUST be reviewed by at least one team member
- Performance-critical changes MUST be reviewed by a senior developer
- API changes MUST be reviewed by the project lead
- All constitutional compliance MUST be verified during review

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All PRs and code reviews MUST verify compliance with these principles. Any complexity that violates these principles MUST be justified with clear rationale and approved by the project lead. 

Constitutional violations are only acceptable when:
1. The violation is temporary and has a clear migration path
2. The business value significantly outweighs the technical debt
3. Alternative approaches have been evaluated and rejected with documented reasoning
