# Research: PowerTimeline Component Implementation

## React 18 + D3.js Integration Patterns

**Decision**: Use React for component structure and state management, D3.js for data visualization calculations and DOM manipulation within SVG elements

**Rationale**: 
- React 18's concurrent features (startTransition, useDeferredValue) optimize performance for large dataset rendering
- D3.js provides robust time scales, axis generation, shape generators, and zoom behaviors that would be complex to recreate
- SVG provides scalable, crisp vector graphics ideal for timeline visualization with easy DOM-based event handling
- Standard React + D3 pattern: React manages container, D3 manipulates children

**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure React + SVG: Would require recreating D3's time scale and axis logic (significant development overhead)
- Canvas-based rendering: Better performance but loses DOM event handling and accessibility features
- Third-party charting libraries: Less flexible, may not support all required timeline features

## Performance Optimization Strategies

**Decision**: Implement viewport-based virtualization with configurable buffer zones, React 18 concurrent features, and efficient data structures

**Rationale**:
- Virtualization essential for >1k items to maintain 60fps performance
- React 18's startTransition allows non-urgent updates during pan/zoom without blocking UI
- useDeferredValue defers expensive calculations during rapid interactions
- Automatic batching reduces re-renders during state updates

**Alternatives considered**:
- Full dataset rendering: Would fail performance requirements for large datasets
- Canvas virtualization: Better performance but sacrifices accessibility and DOM events
- Web Workers: Adds complexity without clear benefit for this use case

## TypeScript Architecture

**Decision**: Strict TypeScript with comprehensive interfaces, generic types for extensibility, and JSDoc documentation

**Rationale**:
- Strict typing prevents runtime errors in complex data transformations
- Generic interfaces allow customization while maintaining type safety
- JSDoc provides IDE support and generated documentation
- Follows constitutional requirement for TypeScript-first API design

**Alternatives considered**:
- JavaScript with PropTypes: Less type safety, no compile-time checking
- Loose TypeScript: Would miss type errors in complex D3 integrations

## Accessibility Implementation

**Decision**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and screen reader support

**Rationale**:
- Timeline role with appropriate ARIA labels for data items
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys for time navigation, tab for focus management)
- Live regions for dynamic content updates during pan/zoom
- Focus indicators and logical tab order
- Color-independent information conveyance

**Alternatives considered**:
- Basic accessibility: Would not meet constitutional requirements
- Canvas-based approach: Would sacrifice built-in SVG accessibility features

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: TDD with Vitest, React Testing Library, Storybook, and Playwright for comprehensive coverage

**Rationale**:
- Vitest provides fast unit testing with TypeScript support
- React Testing Library ensures accessibility-focused testing
- Storybook enables visual testing and documentation
- Playwright handles visual regression and interaction testing
- Performance benchmarks validate rendering and memory requirements

**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest: Slower than Vitest, less modern TypeScript support
- Cypress: Good for e2e but Playwright better for component testing
- Manual testing only: Would not meet constitutional TDD requirements

## Bundle Optimization

**Decision**: Tree-shakeable exports, dynamic imports for large dependencies, and optimized D3 imports

**Rationale**:
- Import only required D3 modules (d3-scale, d3-axis, d3-zoom, d3-shape) to minimize bundle size
- Tree-shakeable component exports allow consumers to import only needed components
- Dynamic imports for heavy features (e.g., accessibility utilities) when needed
- Target <200KB gzipped bundle size

**Alternatives considered**:
- Full D3 import: Would exceed bundle size requirements
- Custom implementations: Would increase development time and maintenance burden

## State Management

**Decision**: React 18 built-in state management with custom hooks for complex logic

**Rationale**:
- useState and useReducer sufficient for component-level state
- Custom hooks (useTimeScale, useVirtualization, useD3Zoom) encapsulate complex logic
- React 18's automatic batching optimizes state updates
- No external state management needed for component library

**Alternatives considered**:
- Redux/Zustand: Overkill for component-level state management
- Context API: Not needed for component library (parent apps handle global state)

## Development Tooling

**Decision**: Vite for development and building, ESLint + Prettier for code quality, Storybook for development environment

**Rationale**:
- Vite provides fast development server and optimized builds
- ESLint catches TypeScript and React issues
- Prettier ensures consistent formatting
- Storybook provides isolated development environment for components

**Alternatives considered**:
- Webpack: Slower development experience than Vite
- Rollup: Good for libraries but Vite provides better DX
- Create React App: Too opinionated and slower than Vite
