# Implementation Plan: PowerTimeline Component Initial Implementation

**Branch**: `001-initial-implementation-of` | **Date**: October 4, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-initial-implementation-of/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code, or `AGENTS.md` for all other agents).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
PowerTimeline is a high-performance, interactive React component for visualizing multi-layered time-series data. It supports three data types (curves, events, time ranges) across configurable lanes with smooth pan/zoom navigation, dynamic data loading, and responsive touch/mouse interactions. The component prioritizes performance through virtualization and leverages React 18 + D3.js + SVG for optimal rendering of large datasets.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+ with React 18.2+  
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18, D3.js 7.x, TypeScript, Vite/Webpack for bundling  
**Storage**: N/A (component library - data provided by parent applications)  
**Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, Storybook, Playwright for visual regression  
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
**Project Type**: Single project (React component library)  
**Performance Goals**: 60fps interactions, <100ms initial render for 10k+ data points, <200KB bundle size  
**Constraints**: <50MB memory usage, viewport-based virtualization for >1k items, WCAG 2.1 AA compliance  
**Scale/Scope**: Reusable component library supporting 10k+ data points across multiple lanes

**Structure Decision**: Single project React component library structure with clear separation of components, hooks, utilities, comprehensive testing, and practical examples. Each component follows the pattern of main component file, types file, and index for clean exports.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command) - ✅ research.md created with all technology decisions
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command) - ✅ data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md, CLAUDE.md created

- [x] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command) - ✅ tasks.md created with 68 detailed, ordered tasks
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:

- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS - Design maintains constitutional compliance
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved - Technical context fully specified
- [x] Complexity deviations documented - No constitutional violations identified
