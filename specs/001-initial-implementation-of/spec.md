# Feature Specification: PowerTimeline Component Initial Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `001-initial-implementation-of`
**Created**: October 4, 2025
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "initial implementation of powertimeline component"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer integrates the PowerTimeline component into their application to display time-series data across multiple lanes. Users can navigate through time by panning horizontally and zooming in/out to see different levels of detail. The component displays three types of data: continuous curves (line charts), point-in-time events, and time ranges (bars). Users can interact with data items to trigger custom actions in the parent application.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a PowerTimeline component with multiple lanes containing different data types, **When** a user scrolls horizontally, **Then** the timeline pans smoothly and triggers data loading callbacks for newly visible time ranges
2. **Given** a timeline displaying data at a monthly view, **When** a user zooms in using mouse wheel or pinch gestures, **Then** the view transitions to show more granular time periods (weeks, days, hours) with appropriate axis labels
3. **Given** data items displayed on the timeline, **When** a user clicks on a curve point, event marker, or time range bar, **Then** the component triggers the appropriate callback with the item's data
4. **Given** a timeline with dense data, **When** the component renders, **Then** only items within the visible viewport (plus buffer) are rendered to maintain performance
5. **Given** a timeline on a mobile device, **When** a user performs touch gestures, **Then** pan and zoom interactions work smoothly with touch input

### Edge Cases
- When no data is available for the visible time range, component shows empty lanes
- Overlapping time range items in the same lane are stacked with most recent items on top by default
- When users zoom beyond available data boundaries, component triggers data loading for extended ranges
- Component performance targets will be determined during implementation based on actual rendering benchmarks
- When lane heights are insufficient for stacked overlapping items, component expands lane height or shows scroll indicators

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Component MUST render multiple configurable lanes for organizing different data streams
- **FR-002**: Component MUST support three distinct data types: curves (line charts), events (point markers), and time ranges (bars)
- **FR-003**: Component MUST provide smooth horizontal panning navigation through time
- **FR-004**: Component MUST support zooming in/out with automatic time axis label adjustment
- **FR-005**: Component MUST trigger callbacks when the visible time range changes to enable dynamic data loading
- **FR-006**: Component MUST support click and hover interactions on all data items
- **FR-007**: Component MUST work responsively on both desktop (mouse) and mobile (touch) devices
- **FR-008**: Component MUST render only visible items plus configurable buffer zone for performance optimization (default: 50% of viewport width on each side)
- **FR-009**: Component MUST accept an initial time range to define the starting view
- **FR-010**: Component MUST provide configurable styling for lanes and data items
- **FR-011**: Component MUST display a time axis with appropriate granularity based on zoom level
- **FR-012**: Component MUST handle overlapping time range items by stacking them vertically within lanes (most recent items on top by default, with configurable stacking order)
- **FR-013**: Component MUST show "No data" message in empty lanes when no data is available for the visible time range
- **FR-014**: Component MUST trigger data loading callbacks when users zoom beyond available data boundaries to fetch extended ranges

### Key Entities
- **Lane**: A horizontal container that groups related data items, with configurable height and styling
- **Curve Item**: Time-series data represented as connected line segments with optional fill areas
- **Event Item**: Point-in-time occurrences displayed as markers (lines, circles, or custom shapes)
- **Time Range Item**: Duration-based data displayed as horizontal bars with start and end times
- **Time Scale**: The mapping between time domain and pixel coordinates for positioning items
- **Viewport**: The currently visible time range and spatial area of the timeline

### Configuration & Performance Specifications
- **Buffer Zone**: Configurable rendering buffer extending beyond visible viewport (default: 50% of viewport width on each side)
- **Stacking Order**: Configurable algorithm for overlapping time range items (default: most recent items on top)
- **Performance Targets**: To be determined during implementation through benchmarking and optimization
- **Empty State**: Standardized "No data" messaging for lanes without data in visible time range
- **Zoom Boundaries**: Automatic data loading triggers when users zoom beyond current data boundaries
