## Validation Checklist

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T006-T014)
- [x] All entities have implementation tasks (T021-T038)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (Phase 3.2 before 3.3)
- [x] Examples tasks included for /examples folder (T051-T055)
- [x] Accessibility and Storybook tasks included (T020, T042, T059)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files, no shared dependencies)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Performance benchmarks included (T045-T047)
- [x] Visual regression tests included (T060-T062)
- [x] TDD approach enforced (tests must fail before implementation)

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **Verify tests fail** before implementing (TDD requirement)
- **Commit after each task** for clean history
- **Constitutional compliance** verified in each phase
- **Performance targets**: 60fps interactions, <100ms render, <200KB bundle, <50MB memory
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout
